# Minimal open questions

These are theorem targets selected after the carrier-capacity checkpoint, not
a catalogue of neighboring ideas.  The unrestricted syndrome dichotomy is no
longer the lead question: a composition-stable subexponential response net and
a quadratic-bit macroscopic packing are both proved.  Optimizing that gap is
secondary to understanding the new carrier law.

## 1. Find a small cycle-faithful quotient without partition enumeration

The exposed-carrier dichotomy is now sharp in general. One polynomial-size
continuous rational lattice-PWA selector circuit plus one identity probe has
`2^(r-o(r))` exposed recurrent states below per-step error `1/2`. A globally
affine selector and a strict irreducible max-plus-linear map remain
Landau-subexponential. Thus compactness, rationality, nonexpansiveness, a fixed
alphabet, and polynomial presentation do not guarantee compression; the
min/max switching class can already encode essentially every Boolean phase.

For a *proposed* finite input congruence, Theorem 17.1l computes its optimal
asymptotic reward error by a raw-cycle linear program. But feasible
bounded-error congruences are not closed under join, so ordinary monotone
Nerode/bisimulation refinement cannot discover a canonical coarsest one.
The finite projective-semigroup carrier is exact but output-sensitive.

Theorem 17.1n now gives a nontrivial structural certificate: a dominating
coarse system plus a coherent **path-lifting relation** preserves all aligned
word responses, even when the microscopic representative must switch along
the path. Pairwise commuting max-plus generators collapse further to a common
eigenprofile. In the opposite direction, finding the smallest general
cycle-compatible congruence is NP-complete even for identity or rank-one
reset dynamics.

The de Bruijn family now falsifies the most obvious response-to-structure
converse: after blocking `2m` letters, every product is projectively rank one,
has contraction coefficient zero and a uniquely exposed critical node, yet
every sub-`m`-defect block path lift retains all `2^m` states. Uniform
scrambling and wordwise exposed uniqueness do not synchronize the critical
seed across different future words.

The scalar `{0,-C}` case now has a complete answer, and Theorem 17.1s extends
it to arbitrary weighted coarse systems: finite endpoint-support families,
backward-surjective lifts, and a support potential give quantitative all-word
spectral control. The width-two Ising example proves this is strictly smaller
than forward transfer state and genuinely needs state-dependent tolls.

The support-certificate converse is now closed at its natural level. Theorem
18.5 identifies its optimal toll with a finite mean-payoff support game. But
the deterministic de Bruijn shift proves that the resulting carrier size is
not semantic response information: scalar response and rowwise state both
have size one while exact target-surjective support needs `q^m` states. Its
certificate tradeoff is `Theta(C/(1+log_qN))`.

The next target is therefore **witness observability**, not another twins
variant:

```math
\text{which minimal future probes turn hidden witness phase}
\quad\text{into an intrinsic response packing?}               \tag{OQ.1}
```

Seek a theorem that starts with a support game and a declared probe family,
computes the induced behavioral pseudometric on support phases, and either
produces a smaller semantic quotient or a pumpable response packing. It must
distinguish the free-tail and deterministic de Bruijn systems without using
the carrier size itself as the answer.

**Success:** a quantitative observability theorem relating probe entropy,
support-game phase, and actual future-response packing in at least two model
classes.

**Stop condition:** support count is only proof complexity until a future can
observe it. Do not infer a semantic lower bound from failure of one
backward-surjective or rowwise certificate.

The one-generator PWA question is closed: the binary/block counter proves
`2^(r-o(r))` exposed classes. Do not spend another campaign optimizing that
base unless it yields a positive quotient theorem elsewhere.

## 2. Prove a same-input recoupling theorem at linear channel rank

For mixed-relation models, composition creates a homomorphism

```math
h:K=Z/Z_{\rm loc}\longrightarrow W
```

and a presented carrier `C_h=h(K)`.  Theorem 12.3 reduces response complexity
to carrier metric entropy.  Theorem 13.3 identifies the optimal synchronizing
quotient rank with anticode codimension, while Theorem 13.4 proves that binary
Hamming separated rank lies a linear amount below it.  Universal scale-rank
duality is therefore false.

The actual Grassmannian packing is

```math
P_{D,k}(\Delta)=
\log_2\operatorname{Pack}
\bigl(\operatorname{Gr}_k(F_2^D),d_H,\Delta\bigr).
```

The unrestricted form of this question has now been reduced to a recognized
hard object.  At `k=1`, Theorem 14.3 proves

```math
A_2(D,\Delta+1)-1\le P_{D,1}(\Delta)\le A_2(D,\Delta+1),
```

so its packing exponent is the classical unrestricted binary coding rate.
An explicit probabilistic line cover, using the exact line-ball volume,
proves separately that puncturing retains exponentially too many states.
Thus neither a universal closed exponent nor anticode-quotient optimality is
a credible next target.

At `k=kappa D`, a systematic carrier has generator `[I_k|X]`, and

```math
d_H(C_X,C_Y)\le
\max_u wt(u(X-Y))
\le d_{\rm column}(X,Y).
```

The outer column alphabet has size `2^k`, large enough for Reed--Solomon
codes to meet Singleton.  Ordinary column coding therefore reproduces the
puncturing exponent and cannot narrow the gap.  The next theorem must charge
the **same-input recoupling** in the first inequality.

For fixed admissible `kappa,delta`, prove either

```math
\log_2P_{D,\lfloor\kappa D\rfloor}(\lfloor\delta D\rfloor)
\le
\bigl(\kappa(1-\delta-\kappa)-c_{\kappa,\delta}\bigr)D^2
+o(D^2)                                                        \tag{OQ.2}
```

for some explicit `c_(kappa,delta)>0`, or construct a matching
quadratic-bit family showing that no such recoupling gain exists.

**Success:** a positive recoupling exponent in one nontrivial linear regime,
or a construction saturating puncturing after the exact Hausdorff metric is
verified, transferred through the presentation toll to a response
rate--distortion theorem.

**Stop condition:** a bound only on the number of differing columns cannot
work: the growing-alphabet shadow already meets Singleton.  Likewise, the
sparse-flat spectrum exactly counts directed balls but is not two-sided
sufficient; isometric quotient norms can have a linear rooted-response gap.

This remains the sharpest model-specific target.  It asks whether
composition turns the microscopic coupling between a quotient and its rooted
lifts into quadratic-scale response information.

## 3. A natural strict metric synchronization

Theorem 12.5 shows that one uniform approximate submetry
`varpi:X->Y` compresses all presented carriers when four conditions hold:
subscale fibres/lift defect, smaller projected-carrier entropy, descended
composition, and controlled presentation radius.  The designed two-scale
metric satisfies all four; rank-row projection and puncturing presently prove
only the small-error factor.

Find a natural model with growing interface in which all four conditions are
forced by the model rather than installed by hand.

**Success:** a strict quotient whose state has asymptotically smaller metric
entropy than the full carrier class and whose error remains subscale under
unbounded composition depth.

**Stop condition:** an identity map, a projection with no entropy saving, or
a fixed-context approximation without a descended state update is not
compression.

## 4. Query-mass-sensitive carrier capacity

The uniform carrier law is sharp.  Under a query distribution, Theorem 12.3
only gives the local exposure bound

```math
(\Delta-2r-p)_+\,\mu(B(x_0,r))^{1/s}.
```

In Hamming and rank-metric ambient spaces this mass may be exponentially
small.  Determine when a carrier family has a *massive* collection of
separating witnesses rather than isolated Hausdorff witnesses.

**Success:** a geometric or algebraic condition implying an `L^2` or mutual-
information lower bound of the same exponential order as uniform carrier
packing, with an application outside the finite-field Hamming example.

**Falsifier:** a full uniform carrier packing whose normalized distance
transforms all collapse under the proposed diffuse query law.

Do not infer average hardness from one endpoint witness; its neighborhood
mass must be charged explicitly.

## 5. Bridge complexity between rank and regularity

The fixed-rank port is now exact: upper roofs compose associatively, explicit
feature quantization uses `exp(O(r log(1/epsilon)))` cells, and an unrestricted
bounded class needs `2^(Omega(r))` response bits. A matching bridge shows that
bounded edge degree alone can still carry exponentially many macroscopic
bits. Signed-balanced `alpha I+beta J` bridges give a different positive
mechanism: a common optimizer section defeats full algebraic rank.

The sharp next target is a structural parameter between these extremes.
Candidates must control the *exposed bridge-response image*, not rank or
sparsity by name. One possibility is exposed/query-dependent dimension;
another is a signed block replacement at the natural extremal scale.

```math
\text{Find }B_n\text{ with subexponential state and }
||A_n-B_n||_square=o(n^{3/2}),                                 \tag{OQ.5}
```

for one nontrivial structured dense family, or prove that every such
replacement needs exponential information. Generic Frieze--Kannan regularity
does not suffice: its state can already be exponential at this accuracy.

**Success:** a growing-rank/full-rank family not covered by permutation
synchronization with a subextensive all-future response quotient, or an
intrinsic response packing excluding one proposed family.

**Falsifier:** a response-separated code inside the proposed port, or a
four-label pinned cut-norm witness at order `n^(3/2)`.

## 6. Constrained compactness and realization

Fixed-interface response bodies have unrestricted finite recovery sequences.
Characterize which limiting response or presented-carrier states are realized
at all large sizes inside a constrained family such as linear codes, dense
CSPs, or bounded-width factor graphs.

**Success:** a Gamma-limsup/recovery theorem preserving the declared response
with vanishing normalized loss and without storing a target optimizer.

**Stop condition:** finite-state approximation outside the constrained model
does not answer this question.

## Reconnection rule

Do not return to the motivating signing problem.  Reconnection requires a
carrier or synchronized quotient that arises naturally there, has controlled
growing-interface entropy, closes under the relevant composition, and has a
finite realization theorem.  The signed-balanced benchmark supplies all of
these only for a restricted permutation-invariant class; none is currently
proved for the motivating sign matrices.
