# Minimal open questions

These are theorem targets selected after the carrier-capacity checkpoint, not
a catalogue of neighboring ideas.  The unrestricted syndrome dichotomy is no
longer the lead question: a composition-stable subexponential response net and
a quadratic-bit macroscopic packing are both proved.  Optimizing that gap is
secondary to understanding the new carrier law.

## 1. Preserve the directed response algebra beyond exact products

Theorem 15.1 gives the first strict, growing-depth feature algebra in this
phase:

```math
r(a,b)=\sup_x(f_a(x)-f_b(x)),
```

and product response distances are exactly the maximum of the two oriented
sums of `r`.  This closes because product minimization and query coordinates
separate.  A useful theory must now survive one genuinely nonproduct
operation.

Let a common min-plus continuation act by

```math
(T_Kf)(x)=\min_y\{K(x,y)+f(y)\}.
```

It always contracts directed response weights.  Find natural finite
hypotheses—stated in terms of exposed minimizers, a synchronization quotient,
or bounded coupling width—under which, for a declared alphabet,

```math
r(T_Kf_a,T_Kf_b)
\ge r(f_a,f_b)-\varepsilon                                  \tag{OQ.1}
```

in both orientations, with cumulative loss sublinear over the intended
composition depth.

**Success:** a checkable condition verified in a nonproduct Hamming,
rank-metric, code, or CSP model, where the directed table remains strictly
smaller than the full response functions.

**Stop condition:** assuming (OQ.1), using an identity kernel, or storing all
kernel rows is not synchronization.  The theorem must derive preservation
from less information than the complete continuation landscape.

This is the single most important next theorem.  It tests whether the exact
product law is a reusable theory or only a polished concatenated-code fact.

## 2. Prove a same-input recoupling theorem at linear channel rank

For mixed-relation models, composition creates a homomorphism

```math
h:K=Z/Z_{\rm loc}\longrightarrow W
```

and a presented carrier `C_h=h(K)`.  Theorem 12.3 reduces response complexity
to carrier metric entropy.  Theorem 13.3 identifies the optimal synchronizing
quotient rank with anticode codimension, while Theorem 13.4 proves that binary
Hamming separated rank lies a linear amount below it.  Universal scale-rank
duality is therefore false.

The actual Grassmannian packing is

```math
P_{D,k}(\Delta)=
\log_2\operatorname{Pack}
\bigl(\operatorname{Gr}_k(F_2^D),d_H,\Delta\bigr).
```

The unrestricted form of this question has now been reduced to a recognized
hard object.  At `k=1`, Theorem 14.3 proves

```math
A_2(D,\Delta+1)-1\le P_{D,1}(\Delta)\le A_2(D,\Delta+1),
```

so its packing exponent is the classical unrestricted binary coding rate.
An explicit probabilistic line cover, using the exact line-ball volume,
proves separately that puncturing retains exponentially too many states.
Thus neither a universal closed exponent nor anticode-quotient optimality is
a credible next target.

At `k=kappa D`, a systematic carrier has generator `[I_k|X]`, and

```math
d_H(C_X,C_Y)\le
\max_u wt(u(X-Y))
\le d_{\rm column}(X,Y).
```

The outer column alphabet has size `2^k`, large enough for Reed--Solomon
codes to meet Singleton.  Ordinary column coding therefore reproduces the
puncturing exponent and cannot narrow the gap.  The next theorem must charge
the **same-input recoupling** in the first inequality.

For fixed admissible `kappa,delta`, prove either

```math
\log_2P_{D,\lfloor\kappa D\rfloor}(\lfloor\delta D\rfloor)
\le
\bigl(\kappa(1-\delta-\kappa)-c_{\kappa,\delta}\bigr)D^2
+o(D^2)                                                        \tag{OQ.2}
```

for some explicit `c_(kappa,delta)>0`, or construct a matching
quadratic-bit family showing that no such recoupling gain exists.

**Success:** a positive recoupling exponent in one nontrivial linear regime,
or a construction saturating puncturing after the exact Hausdorff metric is
verified, transferred through the presentation toll to a response
rate--distortion theorem.

**Stop condition:** a bound only on the number of differing columns cannot
work: the growing-alphabet shadow already meets Singleton.  Likewise, the
sparse-flat spectrum exactly counts directed balls but is not two-sided
sufficient; isometric quotient norms can have a linear rooted-response gap.

This remains the sharpest model-specific target.  It asks whether
composition turns the microscopic coupling between a quotient and its rooted
lifts into quadratic-scale response information.

## 3. A natural strict metric synchronization

Theorem 12.5 shows that one uniform approximate submetry
`varpi:X->Y` compresses all presented carriers when four conditions hold:
subscale fibres/lift defect, smaller projected-carrier entropy, descended
composition, and controlled presentation radius.  The designed two-scale
metric satisfies all four; rank-row projection and puncturing presently prove
only the small-error factor.

Find a natural model with growing interface in which all four conditions are
forced by the model rather than installed by hand.

**Success:** a strict quotient whose state has asymptotically smaller metric
entropy than the full carrier class and whose error remains subscale under
unbounded composition depth.

**Stop condition:** an identity map, a projection with no entropy saving, or
a fixed-context approximation without a descended state update is not
compression.

## 4. Query-mass-sensitive carrier capacity

The uniform carrier law is sharp.  Under a query distribution, Theorem 12.3
only gives the local exposure bound

```math
(\Delta-2r-p)_+\,\mu(B(x_0,r))^{1/s}.
```

In Hamming and rank-metric ambient spaces this mass may be exponentially
small.  Determine when a carrier family has a *massive* collection of
separating witnesses rather than isolated Hausdorff witnesses.

**Success:** a geometric or algebraic condition implying an `L^2` or mutual-
information lower bound of the same exponential order as uniform carrier
packing, with an application outside the finite-field Hamming example.

**Falsifier:** a full uniform carrier packing whose normalized distance
transforms all collapse under the proposed diffuse query law.

Do not infer average hardness from one endpoint witness; its neighborhood
mass must be charged explicitly.

## 5. Effective-rank composition beyond fixed dimension

Shapley--Folkman bounds the loss from replacing a nonconvex reachable sum by
its convex roof by the `r` largest component diameters, where `r` is the
effective affine-difference rank.  Determine whether **exposed** or
query-dependent dimension can replace `r`.

**Success:** a bound controlled by the dimension or Gaussian width of faces
actually reached by a declared Lipschitz query, with subextensive error in a
model where ambient rank grows.

**Falsifier:** a same-roof pair with low exposed complexity for every local
component but a leading composed response gap.

## 6. Constrained compactness and realization

Fixed-interface response bodies have unrestricted finite recovery sequences.
Characterize which limiting response or presented-carrier states are realized
at all large sizes inside a constrained family such as linear codes, dense
CSPs, or bounded-width factor graphs.

**Success:** a Gamma-limsup/recovery theorem preserving the declared response
with vanishing normalized loss and without storing a target optimizer.

**Stop condition:** finite-state approximation outside the constrained model
does not answer this question.

## Reconnection rule

Do not return to the motivating signing problem.  Reconnection requires a
carrier or synchronized quotient that arises naturally there, has controlled
growing-interface entropy, closes under the relevant composition, and has a
finite realization theorem.  None is currently proved.
